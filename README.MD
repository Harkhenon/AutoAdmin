Welcome on that old repo!

AutoAdmin was a Counter Strike Source/Team Fortress 2 tool it could promote a simple user to moderator or administrator rank after a little payment.
I posted the code here, as public archive, to allow visitors to see my firsts attemps of making PHP code.
That tool was a training and it has been created on 2008 with PHP4 (PHP5 after a big upgrade).

This repo is no longer maintained and I hadn't retrieved the BDD file, sorry.
